Giphy is a demo application showing images from [GIPHY](https://giphy.com/). It contains two screens:
* Screen 1:
  * Display lasted  images from Giphy by getting data from Giphy’s Trending API.
  * The images are displayed in still format.
  * An infinite scrolling mechanism is implemented where, whenever the user scrolls  to the bottom of the list, it should be populated with more images.
* Screen 2:
  * Upon tapping on any of the images in Screen 1, this new screen should open up, which displays the animated version of this GIF.
  * This screen should also make use of Giphy’s Random API to automatically load a new random animated GIF (in the file format of your liking) every 10 seconds.
  * Upon tapping back on this view, the user should be taken back to Screen 1.
